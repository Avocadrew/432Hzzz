## Introduction
Thinking at the perspective of one who is hard of hearing, we devote ourselves into finding another method to present the magic of music. Through various experiments trying to make a connection between the auxiliary device and the user, we developed a way to visualize sound and give support to those who are unable to enjoy the beat and the melody through their ears, to connect them with the musical album we created.
